  <p>
    To use the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your system. Additionally, you can follow these steps to set up the project:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the repository:
      <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/barrosyan/computational_physics_studies.git</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Navigate to the project directory:
      <pre><code>cd computational_physics_studies</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
      <pre><code>python3 -m venv venv</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Activate the virtual environment:
      <pre><code>source venv/bin/activate</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Install the required dependencies:
      <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
